AIRob Lab - UAV Project TODOs

PX4 and ArduPilot (APM) - flight controller firmware
INAV
Beta flight - for FPVs (lacks waypoint following capabilities)
FPV - first person view
RViz trajectory simulation testing + Vicon

Likely firmware to use: PX4 / APM

TODOs

Send Fusion account info to Zander and join design team workspace - verify it is using the academic license
Waypoint finding
Pipeline flight testing with multi-agent UAVs (multiple drones)
RViz test simulation - simulate trajectories with waypoints
Rare for problems with gimbal locks to occur with drones; usually safety for 6 DoF robotic manipulators

Design tracker mount to install on a drone, then test it Vicon
Vicon testing with multiple drones
Waypoint following for 1 drone
Waypoint following for multiple drones

DEMOs

Demo for multi-agent flight
Waypoint following demo
Multi-drone waypoint following

UPCOMING

Jan 19 - expected arrival of new drone package
Two types of drones, 1 controller
1 prebuilt, 1 package with parts - to build
Raspberry Pi and depth cameras + onboard navigation
RPi is doing the planning and comms with controller via Mavlink
Mavlink tells controller procedure for motors
Omnidirectional wheel base + ground robot

ROS1 --> ROS2

When running FCU core - running ROS1
ROS bridge uses topic names, but some topic names are not compatible with both ROS1 and ROS2
Topic name - basically a C struct that has some defined fields - if fields are not standard ROS fields,
then you need to create custom definitions
Topic names can be found in the fcu_core software - check definitions

REPOs

1 git repo for documentation
1 git repo for fcu_core software
submodule - reference - if you're git repo has dependencies from another repo, and then you nest them:
create a git repo for the module inside

INFO

When modding the drones, recalibrate PID control using app to change PID coefficients
CAD design for waypoint markers on the drones to map location - mount trackers
Option: design mount for battery

TECH

Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga - Zander's laptop
T series or X series
