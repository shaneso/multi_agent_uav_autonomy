new batteries
  - 1000 mAh battery with 2SLiPO batteries
build frame for new batteries
handle PID tuning to offset alterations from new battery frame
drone firmware designed for stm32
PID tuning
- get sensor data from IMUs
- calculate delta between current and desired states
- proportional integration
- proportional differentiation
- tell controller to calibrate and correct actions based on PID tuning
- PID tuning from MATLAB

TODOs
- Zander: test new batteries and verify compatibility
- Shane: check how code is sending commands to drones to specific position
  - fcu_mission.cpp
- Flight testing for one UAV from source code
- Flight testing for all UAVs from source code
- Set up Vicon motion capture system
